### Mediator Pattern

Imagine an application in which there are many objects that are communicating with each other. The mediator design pattern is useful when the number of objects grows so large that it becomes difficult to maintain the references to the objects. The mediator is essentially an object that encapsulates how one or more objects interact with each other. The mediator design pattern controls how these objects communicate, and helps to reduce the number of dependencies among them that you have to manage.

In the mediator design pattern, the objects donâ€™t communicate with one another directly but through the mediator. When an object needs to communicate with another object or a set of objects, it transmits the message to the mediator. The mediator then transmits the message to each receiver object in a form that is understandable to it.

By eliminating the direct communication between objects, the mediator design pattern promotes loose coupling. The other benefit of using the mediator design pattern is that it improves code readability and maintainability.

### SignalR

ASP.NET SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications. What is "real-time web" functionality? It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time.
